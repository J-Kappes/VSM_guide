This is a Manual.\par
Its objectives are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item firstly, to provide you with a set of tools which will enable you to deal with any problems concerning your organisational structure, and
	\item secondly, to show you how to use these tools.
\end{itemize}
It offers an alternative to the usual approach which depends upon hierarchy, authority and obedience, and is of particular interest to enterprises which are looking for ways of becoming more efficient and of encouraging participation and democratic work practices.

As the manual unfolds, you will gradually acquire a new vocabulary. This new language is the basis of the Viable Systems Model approach: it will enable you to think about your organisation in a fundamentally different way.

The methods described will enable you to

\begin{itemize}
	\item Diagnose your own organisation

	\item Prescribe ways of dealing with inadequacies

	\item Design a healthy organisation from scratch.
\end{itemize}
